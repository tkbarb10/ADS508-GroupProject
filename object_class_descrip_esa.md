***Payloads (PL)***, space object designed to perform specific function in space excluding launch functionality. This includes operational satellites as well as calibration objects.  

***Payload mission related objects (PM)***, space objects released as space debris which served a purpose for the function of a payload. Common examples include covers for optical instruments or astronaut tools.  

***Payload fragmentation debris (PF)***, space objects fragmented or unintentionally released from a payload as space debris for which their genesis can be traced back to a unique event. This class includes objects created when a payload explodes or when it collides with another object.  

***Payload debris (PD)***, space objects fragmented or unintentionally released from a payload as space debris for which the genesis is unclear but orbital or physical properties enable a correlation with a source.  

***Rocket body (RB)***, space object designed to perform launch related functionality; This includes the various orbital stages of launch vehicles, but not payloads which release smaller payloads themselves.  

***Rocket mission related objects (RM)***, space objects intentionally released as space debris which served a purpose for the function of a rocket body. Common examples include shrouds and engines.  

***Rocket fragmentation debris (RF)***, space objects fragmented or unintentionally released from a rocket body as space debris for which their genesis can be traced back to a unique event. This class includes objects created when a launch vehicle explodes.  

***Rocket debris (RD)***, space objects fragmented or unintentionally released from a rocket body as space debris for which the genesis is unclear but orbital or physical properties enable a correlation with a source.
